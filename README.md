# ThinMint
Python Script that pulls information from Mint.com

This Python script will open a friefox browser window and download financial information to be stored in Excel. Here's how to install it.

1. Install Python Using Python 2.7)
2. Dependencies include the following:
    -Beautiful Soup
    -Selenium
    -xlUtils

One nice feature about this is that if you are lazy like me but you want to keep financial records, Windows has a task scheduler that can run this for you. I have my script run at the beginning of every month.
